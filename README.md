## Installation
A step-by-step list of commands/guide that informs how to install
locally an instance of this project.

It is necessary to have Docker installed
on your local machine - get Docker Desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Using cmd, clone the repository from GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/fbaranowski/match_alert`

Then start containers with :

`docker-compose up --build`

Sometimes it may be necessary to run celery task manually.
In order to do that, containers must be running.
Then, it is necessary to enter the container with Django app using:

`docker exec -it <web-container-name> sh`

Next, enter Django shell, import celery tasks and run them:

`python manage.py shell`

`from match_alert.celery_app import scrape_fixtures_results_tables, scrape_teams`

`scrape_fixtures_results_tables.apply()`

`scrape_teams.apply()`
