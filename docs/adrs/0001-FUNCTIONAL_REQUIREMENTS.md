## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to establish functional requirements for our project called match_alert

## Decision

We have setup assumptions as below:
1. Registration, logging, changing and resetting password
2. Use external API or scrape information to make league table with points, match weeks played, goals etc.
3. Scheduling info about next matches with highlighting favourite teams
    - use external API to get info or scrape info about next matches
    - use external API to get info or scrape info about results from previous matches
4. Detail information about specific team
   - schedule and results of this specific team
## Consequences

1. We know what should be implemented in the project
2. Different types of Django applications are clear to do

## Keywords
- functional requirements
